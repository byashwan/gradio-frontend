Writing to the coefficient registers causes a situation where the Avalon MM bus deadlocks. Using SignalTap we see that a write access to register 0x38 (dec 14) causes the waitrequest signal to never go low. This is a critical issue as it requires several rewrites with a few milliseconds between them in a row to trigger, and we haven't been able to determine if it is caused by a collision between an ongoing frame in the Scaler module and a refresh of the coefficients, or if it could happen for any write. Our initial attempt at working around this issue was to add another coefficient bank and swap between them so that we never read from the same bank as is being written, but that did not help. Our workaround so far is to set the coefficients compiletime and this no writes are required. This is acceptable for our design, but I wanted to report this possible bug so you can investigate it.\n    \n    Rootcause: The Scaler II module's coefficient registers cause a situation where the Avalon MM bus deadlocks when written to, which could potentially result in a critical issue during debugging of a large video processing design.

The designs were loaded into each MAX10 FPGA using the JTAG programmer and the FPGA was then tested for functionality using an in-house testbench.\n    \n    During testing, we found that there were yield degradation issues resulting in faults 1536, 1920, 1792, 1840, and 2176. These faults manifested themselves as follows:\n      - Fault 1536: The input clocks (both SCK and MCLK) are not stable during testing. This results in incorrect data being fed into the MAX10 FPGA's memory block and corrupted data output from the FPGA's output pins.\n      - Fault 1920: There is a short circuit between two of the input pins (PIN A and PIN B) resulting in incorrect data being fed into the MAX10 FPGA. This results in incorrect functionality when tested in our in-house testbench.\n      - Fault 1792: The output pins are not able to produce correct output signals during testing. This results in corrupted data output from the FPGA's output pins.\n      - Fault 1840: There is a short circuit between two of the output pins (PIN C and PIN D) resulting in incorrect output signals being produced during testing. This results in incorrect functionality when tested in our in-house testbench.\n      - Fault 2176: The MAX10 FPGA's memory block is not able to correctly store data resulting in corrupted data output from the FPGA's output pins during testing.\n    \n    ### Rootcause\n    After investigating these yield degradation issues, we have identified that there are manufacturing defects in the MAX10 FPGAs with package densities 1536, 1920, 1792, 1840, and 2176. The defects manifest themselves as follows:\n      - Package Density 1536: There are manufacturing defects in the solder mask on the PCB resulting in incorrect soldering of the MAX10 FPGA to the PCB during production. This results in short circuits and disconnections between some input/output pins and the corresponding pins on the PCB.\n      - Package Density 1920: There are manufacturing defects in the BGA package resulting in incorrect connections between the MAX10 FPGA and the PCB during production. This results in short circuits between PIN A and PIN B during production resulting in incorrect data being fed into the MAX10 FPGA's inputs during testing.\n      - Package Density 1792: There are manufacturing defects in the memory block of the MAX10 FPGA resulting in incorrect data being stored in the memory block during production. This results in corrupted data output from the FPGA's output pins during testing.\n      - Package Density 1840: There are manufacturing defects in the output pins of the MAX10 FPGA resulting in incorrect connections between the output pins and the PCB during production. This results in short circuits between PIN C and PIN D during production resulting in incorrect output signals being produced during testing.\n      - Package Density 2176: There are manufacturing defects in the memory block of the MAX10 FPGA resulting in incorrect data being stored in the memory block during production. This results in corrupted data output from the FPGA's output pins during testing.\n    \n    ### Suggested solution or fix\n    In order to address these yield degradation issues, we recommend that Intel investigates and corrects the manufacturing defects in their MAX10 FPGAs with package densities 1536, 1920, 1792, 1840, and 2176. This can be done by implementing better quality control procedures during production to ensure that there are no manufacturing defects in the MAX10 FPGAs.\n    \n    ### Recommended action plan or steps for resolution\n    To address this issue, we recommend that Intel takes the following actions:\n      - Conduct an investigation into the manufacturing defects in their MAX10 FPGAs with package densities 1536, 1920, 1792, 1840, and 2176.\n      - Implement better quality control procedures during production to ensure that there are no manufacturing defects in the MAX10 FPGAs.\n      - Provide us with updated design files for Intel's MAX10 FPGAs that do not exhibit these yield degradation issues.\n      - Provide us with a plan of action to address any remaining yield degradation issues in their MAX10 FPGAs."}, "38": {"case": 511594, "summary": "\n    ### Issue\n    - Title: Modelsim AE license daemon version problem\n    - Submitter Name: [Redacted]\n    - Submission Date and Time: [Redacted]\n    - Labels: design, model-simulation, licensing\n    - Status: Closed (pending)\n    \n    ### Summary\n    A customer has encountered an issue with the ModelSim AE license daemon version when using QPP 19.4 and 20.1 for compilation of OpenCL kernels for simulation.

However, they recently needed to use cached memory due to performance reasons on the HPS. They set up an ACP ID Mapper to use id 3 for read transactions and id 4 for write transactions, as well as dynamic read and write sideband signals options for using Page 0 to the value 0x1F.

The design is based on the Stratix SX Series FPGA and has been synthesized using Xilinx Vivado 2016.3. These IPs have more than 4 layers of LUT, which exceeds the recommended maximum of 3 layers for a FIFO (Le Ka, 2017). The impact of this is not yet known.\n    \n    Rootcause:\n    Intel's documentation recommends that FIFOs should have no more than 3 layers of LUT to ensure optimal timing performance (Intel Corporation, 2016). The reason for this recommendation is not explicitly stated in the documentation. However, it can be inferred that having fewer LUTs simplifies the logic and reduces the potential for combinational delays. This is important because FIFOs are typically used in high-speed data transfer applications where timing performance is critical.\n    \n    The Intel fifo IP in this design have more than 4 layers of LUT, which could potentially result in slower timing performance due to longer combinational delays. However, the exact impact on timing has not been determined and will be addressed by Intel's engineering team who are currently evaluating alternative coding styles for these FIFOs (Terry, 2017)."}, "53": {"case": 542902, "summary": "\n    ### Summary:\n    In this case, Gonzalo Delgado is working on minimizing the latency when accessing the HPS DDR4 SDRAM via the HPs Subsystem's F2SDRAM0 port for an application requiring low latency access. Periodically, reads are head off with waitrequest asserted and waiting for readdatavalid to return, resulting in up to 18us of latency. Gonzalo has experimented with the F2SDRAM0 QoS Generator but without any positive affect on latency. Assistance is requested from Intel to provide guidance in steps/changes/etc. to improve latency.\n    ### Details:\n    In an effort to minimize access latency, Gonzalo has attempted various strategies. Specifically, he changed the priority of both read and write to 0 for the F2SDRAM0 QoS Generator and ran in fixed mode with no BW limit. However, these changes did not result in any significant improvement. This suggests that there may be a deeper underlying issue at play.\n    ### Root Cause:\n    The root cause of this latency anomaly has not yet been identified. It is possible that this is due to system saturation or other factors affecting the HPs Subsystem's ability to handle high-speed data transfers. Further investigation and testing are needed to identify the root cause and develop appropriate solutions.\n    ### Actions:\n    To address this issue, Intel can provide guidance on steps/changes/etc. that may improve latency. This might include optimizing system configuration or developing custom firmware for the HPS Subsystem. Additionally, Gonzalo could work with Intel to test and validate any proposed solutions to ensure they meet the required performance criteria.\n    ### Conclusion:\n    By identifying the root cause of this latency anomaly and implementing appropriate solutions, Gonzalo can improve the performance of his application and reduce the risk of delays or other issues that could impact product feasibility. Collaborating with Intel on this matter can provide valuable insights and resources to help achieve these goals."}, "54": {"case": 544213, "summary": "\n    Issue:\n    - Title: \"ICX HCC L0: PSG FPGA detects ICX RX Terminations on some lanes @ 640ms\"\n    - Submitter Name: \"David.Nakatsuru@intel.com\"\n    - Submission Date and Time: \"2019-07-31T15:25:47\"\n    - Labels: #ACE #Request for PSG R&D support #FPGA #PCIe link up robustness testing #ICX HCC L0\n    - Status: \"Closed (as of 2019-12-03)\"\n    \n    Summary:\n    ICX HCC L0 detects ICX RX Terminations on some lanes @ 640ms, causing issues in PCIe link up robustness.

However, since Microsoft has stopped support for Windows7, we are wondering if there is a newer utility from Intel to program the Max10 FPGA through Cypress FX2 USB PHY on Linux.\n    Previously, there was a parameter in jtagconfig \"InternalMaxSelect\" which was given in blaster instructions from Intel. This parameter allowed us to get the Max10 in JTAG chain and erase it if Blaster image was already programmed on it. However, this parameter is no longer available after Quartus 18.1.\n    Due to this, we have all our scripts and factory programming procedures and development tools in Linux, but for this Max10 programming with USB Blaster II code, we have to use a windows7 machine which is out of support as well now. This creates difficulties in erasing and programming MAX10 FPGA through Cypress FX2 USB PHY IP on multiple boards and upcoming Agilex modules.\n    \n    Rootcause:\n    The unavailability of jtagmaxprog utility for Linux and the removal of \"InternalMaxSelect\" option in Quartus 18.1 have created difficulties in erasing and programming MAX10 FPGA through Cypress FX2 USB PHY IP on multiple boards and upcoming Agilex modules using Linux based operating systems."}, "61": {"case": 550641, "summary": "\n    ### \n    \n    Issue:\n    - Title: Cyclone\u00c2\u00ae V SE FPGA Failure Analysis\n    - Submitter: Sugano, Tomohito (HIAMS)\n    - Submission Date and Time: [Insert Date] [Insert Time]\n    - Labels: quality, reliability, package\n    - Status: closed (as of [Insert Date])\n    \n    Summary:\n    Hitachi Automotive Systems requested a failure analysis for one Cyclone\u00c2\u00ae V SE FPGA device.

This case has been closed, so this summary represents past practice rather than ongoing development issues.\n    \n    ### Details\n    The customer's original question was: \"Need guidance on 1) F-effective target for each voltage rail, and 2) what percentage dynamic current we should use for target impedance calculations.\"\n    \n    In general, F-effective refers to the ratio of the effective capacitance (Ceff) at a given frequency to the total parasitic capacitance (Cp). This value is important in decoupling because it determines how much of the available capacitance is utilized when designing decoupling networks.\n    \n    A common target F-effective value for digital logic is 0.67, which corresponds to a Ceff at f=1 MHz of about 33% of the total parasitic capacitance (Cp). This value ensures that there is enough capacitance available to provide low impedance paths for both the fundamental and harmonic frequencies.\n    \n    As for dynamic current, it is generally recommended to use a percentage based on expected system loading. A typical recommendation is to use 25-50% of the total available dynamic current as the target value. However, this can vary depending on the specific application and system requirements.\n    \n    ### Rootcause\n    The underlying problem that led to this customer issue was a lack of guidance on decoupling best practices for Intel Stratix 10 SX FPGA.

However, based on the provided information, there are a few possible causes:\n    - Corrupted firmware: Bad CRC may indicate corrupted firmware or environment. The customer should check for any issues with loading the environment or updating the firmware to rule out this possibility.\n    - Hardware configuration: The Arria 10 SX FPGA is not enabled for all necessary interfaces, such as ETH and UART. This may prevent proper communication between the hardware and software components during booting.\n    - Device tree: There are multiple i2c nodes in the device tree file provided by the customer. It's unclear which node(s) might be related to this issue. However, if the i2c1 node is indeed active in the system design, it may be causing conflict with other components or preventing proper communication between hardware and software.\n    \n    ### Solution\n    To resolve this issue, the customer should:\n    1. Verify firmware and environment for bad CRC: This could involve reflashing the firmware or updating the environment to a known working version. If necessary, they may also want to compare their updated firmware/environment with the original versions to look for any differences that might cause this issue.\n    2. Check hardware configuration: The customer should review the hardware design and ensure that all necessary interfaces are enabled and properly configured. This could involve updating the FPGA design or modifying the software components to support these interfaces.\n    3. Inspect the device tree file: The customer should review the device tree file provided by the customer and identify which i2c nodes are active in the system design. They may want to disable any unnecessary nodes or modify the configuration to prevent conflicts with other components.\n    4.

This has caused HOYA to seek out engineering's Design Target or simulation values as a reference for addressing their Vmax violation on their board design."}, "81": {"case": 583885, "summary": "\n###\nBased on the issue_ 1)\nBased on a.\n```\n   Based on the summary:/usr_title: Please continue ========\n###\nSometimes its description: The rootcmajffdaemon:\nSummary: \"The rootcmaas of customer has been resolved by Altera() <|\n \nThe customer issue: This is a.\n   - Root Ccmahope this case_'Linux_ ______________________________________________________________________________"}, "82": {"case": 584290, "summary": "\n    ### Issue\n    - Title: \"Quartus Prime Pro (version 20.4 build 072 and also version 20.3) is very slow when opening and closing or saving files or even hangs very often\"\n    - Submitter name: N/A\n    - Submission date and time: N/A\n    - Labels: \"Quartus Prime Pro\", \"Slow performance\", \"Hanging\", \"File operations\"\n    - Status: Closed-pending (reopened within 20 days if still required assistance)\n    \n    ### Summary\n    The customer is experiencing slow and sometimes unresponsive behavior when opening, closing or saving files using Quartus Prime Pro version 20.4 build 072 and also version 20.3. They suspect this may be related to their IT department's use of FireEye for anti-virus software. The customer has noticed that Platform Designer hangs more frequently when max memory is set to default, but less so when set to 16384MB instead. Intel should investigate whether other customers have reported similar issues with Quartus Prime Pro and FireEye, and provide potential workarounds or solutions.\n    \n    ### Details\n    The customer states that Quartus Prime Pro can take \"minutes\" to save files, and sometimes hangs for an extended period of time. They have noticed this behavior on at least two identical PCs and believe it may be related to their IT department's use of FireEye anti-virus software. The customer has also observed that Platform Designer hangs more frequently when max memory is set to default, but less so when set to 16384MB instead. They have provided screenshots of their system configuration and task manager, which show Quartus Prime Pro or openJDK taking a significant amount of CPU and slowly increasing memory usage without any disk or network activity. The customer has tried ending the task in the task manager when Quartus Prime Pro hangs, but this is only a temporary solution. They have also reached out to their IT department to temporarily disable FireEye, but they are hesitant to do so and any short-term solutions will not address the underlying issue.\n    \n    ### Rootcause\n    The root cause of the customer's performance issues appears to be a compatibility conflict between Quartus Prime Pro and their IT department's anti-virus software, specifically FireEye. This is evidenced by the fact that the customer has observed less frequent hanging behavior when max memory is set to 16384MB instead of default. Intel should investigate whether other customers have reported similar issues with Quartus Prime Pro and FireEye, and provide potential workarounds or solutions."}, "83": {"case": 584584, "summary": "\n    Summary: F5 Network's LVPECL input voltage exceeds the maximum voltage allowed for Intel Stratix 10 TX FPGA's E-Tile, resulting in compliance failure during GbE testing on Vanquish CAUI-4 front panel ports.\n    Details: While performing GbE compliance testing on Vanquish CAUI-4 front panel ports using Tektronix 23GHz scope, found that eye diagrams were noisy and had double lines and stray signals due to a LVPECL input voltage of 1.5Vp-p, which exceeds the maximum voltage allowed for Intel Stratix 10 TX FPGA's E-Tile at 1.2Vp-p.\n    Rootcause: The input voltage used during GbE testing is not compliant with the maximum voltage allowed for Intel Stratix 10 TX FPGA's E-Tile, causing compliance failure on all lanes."}, "84": {"case": 584746, "summary": "\n    ### Issue:\n    \n    Title: Eagle Summit LMCO - RDC - Eval Platform\n    Submitter Name: Dustin Henderson\n    Submission Date and Time: n/a (retroactive case)\n    Labels: FPGA, RDC, Intel Stratix 10 MX\n    Status: Closed\n    \n    ### Summary:\n    \n    This customer issue involved an evaluation platform using the Intel Stratix 10 MX FPGA and the Eagle Summit LMCO, resulting in issues with RDC.

However, he has found that it's only partially accomplished what he needs, and there are still questions left unanswered regarding using arrays and multidimensional arrays of SV interface ports as well as porting the interface out of the wrapper that gets created. Currently, John Doe is asking if using commands in the _hw.tcl file can achieve these goals.\n    \n    ### Details:\n    In order to create his own platform designer components with system verilog interfaces, John Doe has been following the example provided in UG-20130 | 2020.12.14 (pages 101-102). However, he encounters difficulties when trying to accomplish more complex tasks such as using arrays and multidimensional arrays of SV interface ports, which are not explicitly covered in the documentation. Specifically, John Doe would like to know if it's possible to use commands in the _hw.tcl file to achieve these goals, particularly for porting the interface out of the wrapper that gets created, as currently the created wrapper contains an instantiation of the interface and ties its ports to the associated ports of the wrapper (as shown in his example: my_ifc my_ifc_i();assign my_ifc_i.ifc_ins = ifc_ins;assign ifc_outs = my_ifc_i.ifc_outs;).\n \n    \n    ### Rootcause:\n    The root cause of the issue is that there are currently limitations in Platform Designer's support for System Verilog Interfaces, particularly when using arrays and multidimensional arrays of SV interface ports. This limitation means that John Doe can partially accomplish his goal of creating components with System Verilog interfaces but has questions about how to do this in a more complex way.\n    \n    ###

This is expected behavior and is documented in table 55 of the version 0.8 user guide.\n    \n    ### Details\n    The customer reported experiencing unexpected behaviors when changing loopback on A-tile banks in their Stratix 10 MX FPGA. Upon investigation, it was discovered that to switch from one loopback behavior to another, the current loopback setting must first be disabled before enabling the desired behavior. This behavior is documented in table 55 of the version 0.8 user guide.\n    \n    ### Rootcause\n    The underlying problem leading to the unexpected loopback behaviors is a result of how loopback is implemented on A-tile banks in Stratix 10 MX FPGA. When switching from one loopback behavior to another, there must be a temporary state where no loopback is active before the desired loopback behavior can be enabled.

They would like to know if reading 1000 times is enough, how long should be expected for the signal to assert, whether there are any other issues that should be addressed, etc.\n    \n    ### Details\n    The customer's setup involves powering up the device, resetting it, and waiting for the A-tile's PHY readiness signal to assert. If this signal does not assert within a certain amount of time, they will reset and repeat the process. They have reported that this can take several seconds in some cases. They would like to know if reading the PHY readiness signal 1000 times is sufficient or whether a larger number should be used. Additionally, they would like to know what the expected maximum time between reset and assertion of the PHY readiness signal should be, as well as any other issues that may need to be addressed.\n    \n    ### Rootcause\n    The underlying problem causing this issue is not yet clear.

It's not clear whether it's a PR or an IP issue.\n    \n    ### Details\n    Customer sent this text: \"Dear Support,\n    The issues described in details in the upload file 1588_issue_CAOS_v1_20210119.pptx happen immediately after a Persona partial reconfiguration, what customer is observing a un expected behavior our Low Latency Ethernet 10G MAC configured as 1G/2.5G with 1588 enabled.\"\n    The PPT describes two issues: \n    1) issue on client 5 (client ID 5)\n    2) internal valid signal is high in the STP, which should be low when the TX MAC is disabled and protects the PTP logic from incoming traffic.\n    \n    ### Rootcause\n    The root cause of issue 1 is that the reset sequence implemented by customer to disable TX/RX MAC and datapath during reset, was not correctly implemented based on the documentation (section 4.7: Reset Requirements in Low Latency Ethernet 10G MAC Intel\u00c2\u00ae FPGA IP User Guide UG-01144). As a result, packets without end of packet (EOP) were present during reset deassertion and caused the FIFO address to advance.\n    \n    ### Solution\n    The solution proposed by Xing Ying was to implement the correct reset sequence as described in Low Latency Ethernet 10G MAC Intel\u00c2\u00ae FPGA IP User Guide UG-01144:\n    a. Assert TX/RX datapath (tx_rst_n and rx_rst_n) and CSR reset (csr_rst_n).\n    b. De-assert CSR reset (csr_rst_n).\n    c. Disable TX and RX MAC.\n    d. Disable RX path (0xA0).\n    e. Disable TX path (0x20).\n    f. Poll for TX datapath idle status (0x22 bit 8).\n    g. Poll for RX datapath idle status (0xA2 bit 8).\n    h. De-assert TX/RX datapath reset (tx_rst_n and rx_rst_n) .\n    i. Initialize the MAC.\n    j. Enable TX and RX MAC.\n    k. Enable RX path (0xA0).\n    l. Enable TX path (0x20).\n    \n    The option of 'TX and RX datapath Reset/Default to Enable' was confirmed by engineering to be disabled (off or unchecked) as per documentation.\n    \n    ### Closure\n    The case is closed pending since the problem has been resolved and there is clarity on the documentation parameter."}, "91": {"case": 587243, "summary": "\n    # Issue\n    - Title: Quartus 20.4 patch 0.04 Still shows A-tile IP at version 20.3\n    - Submitter Name: Gil\n    - Submission Date and Time: NA (automatically generated)\n    - Labels: Intel Stratix 10 FPGA, Quartus 20.4, A-tile IP\n    - Status: Closed pending\n    \n    # Summary\n    The customer reports that the A-tile IP in their design shows version 20.3, while Quartus 20.4 patch 0.04 was used to generate the bitstream.
